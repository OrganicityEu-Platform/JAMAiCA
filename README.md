# JAMAiCA

JAMAiCA is an Organicity tool designed to allow for semi-automatic annotation of data inside an Organicity smart-city enviroment.

## Architecture

JAMAiCA uses:
* Jubatus to analyse, classify and detect annomalies within the streams of data originating from the cities and experiments taking place inside the Organcity platform.
* The Orion Context Broker as an input source for the streams of data.
* Annotation Service to generate tags for the annotated data and storing data annotations.
